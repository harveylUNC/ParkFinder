# ParkFinder

Park Finder is an all inclusive solution for your park needs. It utilizes the National Park Service API to gather information about parks and uses the Open Weather API to retrieve weather conditions at those parks at the time of the search. Searches are able to be filtered by weather condition and by state and may be saved to your favorites either locally or via the cloud.

Functionality:

Local use if not logged in
Cloud use if logged in
Search for parks by state or by keyword
Filter results dynamically by weather condition at park location
Add/remove parks to/from your favorites (My Saved Results)
Filter favorites by state code
Authentication and cloud databases are made possible with the Google Firebase SDK, Google Firebase Authentication SDK, and the Google Firebase Firestore SDK. This site was hosted using the Firebase CLI and may be visited at the following sites below:
